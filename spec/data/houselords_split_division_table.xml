<p id="S5LV0003P0-00308"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: This brings to light the fundamental difference which divides us from the policy of noble Lords opposite. Their fundamental policy is to make the Government Departments omnipotent in these matters. Local authorities are to be overburdened, the Courts of Law are to be ousted, and Parliament is not to have an opportunity of expressing its opinion. In this case we are considering the effect of withdrawing from the cognisance of Parliament matters not small or unimportant, but matters that may be of great importance, affecting large areas, affecting the expenditure of money, and affecting matters which we think we should have an opportunity of considering. The noble Earl, as I understand, raises two objections to the Amendment of my noble friend. He says, in the first place, the procedure would perhaps occasion delay, but I noticed he was not inclined to drive that argument home. He evidently realised that an argument founded on delay was not a very serious argument, and it cannot be a very serious argument. He began with the delay; if delay occurs at all it will probably take place at a season of the year when building operations are not likely to be pursued with much activity. Apart from that, which is the greater evil&#x2014;that there should be a delay of a few weeks or months on the one hand, or that this matter of public importance should be dealt with over the heads of the public authorities and without any regard to the interests of the ratepayers? Therefore I do not think there is much importance to be attached to the delay that might occur. What</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00309">is the other argument? That Parliament is not a very appropriate court of appeal for a purpose of this kind, and that the mere laying of the scheme on the Table of the Houses of Parliament would not effectually protect the interests we desire to protect. But I can conceive no form of appeal more efficient than that the scheme should lie on the Table of the two Houses and be dealt with in the light of day. It is usual for great charitable schemes to lie on the Table of the Houses of Parliament for our consideration, and when we are told that local inquiry is sufficient to give us all we require may we not recur to that well known case&#x2014;the Swansea case&#x2014;when a local inquiry took place, where the Department ignored the result of the inquiry, and were taken to task for their conduct by a Court of Justice? I have heard nothing to convince me that the proposal of my noble friend is an unreasonable one. I hope he will press his Amendment, and I shall certainly go with him into the Lobby.</p>
