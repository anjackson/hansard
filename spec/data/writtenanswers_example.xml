<title>Food Storage</title>
<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04896">Mr. Canavan asked the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is his latest available information on the amount of surplus food stored <i>(a)</i> in the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> in the European Economic Community and the costs of storage.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04897"><member>Mr. Gummer</member>: A note setting out the volume of United Kingdom and Community intervention stocks, including those of foodstuffs, on the latest available dates is deposited in the Library of the House and is updated monthly.</p>

<title>Veterinary Services</title>
<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04901">Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop asked the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food whether he will make a statement about the restructuring of veterinary investigation centres and their management.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04902"><member>Mr. Jopling</member>: I have carefully considered the proposals for restructuring of veterinary investigation centres in the light of the many comments received from interested organisations and individuals. In addition, we have undertaken a detailed investment 'appraisal of the recommendations made by the efficiency study.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04903">Against this background, I have concluded that the Gloucester centre should be closed but with retention of the badger-tuberculosis unit. I confirm that Chester and Cardiff centres will be closed. Discussions on the future of the Moulton centre have taken place with Northampton county council to ascertain whether it would wish to take it over. It concluded that it did not wish to do so. Accordingly this centre will also be closed. I have also decided that it would be wrong to close both the Leeds and Lincoln centres, which would leave the large pig population in the area without adequate laboratory diagnostic facilities, and concluded that the best course would be to retain and enlarge the Lincoln centre and close that at Leeds. This represents a better option than establishing a new centre in the area.</p>
<col>2</col>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04904">On further examination it is clear that closure of Truro, Starcross, Winchester and Wye centres with their replacement by two new centres would not be cost effective. I have therefore decided not to take any action in relation to these centres. The timing of the closures will require careful consideration and this is now being pursued with a view to implementation during the first half of next year.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04905">Finally, I confirm that we shall be establishing a new and more centralised management structure for the veterinary investigations which I am confident will increase efficiency and enable the more effective deployment of available resources.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-04907"><member>Mrs. Fenner </member><i>[pursuant to her reply,</i> 13 December 1985]: Our policy for the areas of poorer land in the United Kingdom is to take full advantage of the provisions of EC Directive 75/268 on farming in less favoured areas. Accordingly, we secured agreement in Brussels last year to a major extension of these areas which now represent over 50 per cent. of our agricultural land. For many years we have paid headage allowances in them and on 28 November my right hon. Friend the Minister announced an increase in the rates. Within the constraints of the common agricultural policy we are continually seeking ways of assisting these areas. But most of them are riot basically suitable for any form of agricultural production except livestock rearing. It is partly with this in mind that in the new agricultural improvement scheme, introduced on 1 October, we included certain new features to encourage conservationally sensitive investments and diversification.</p>

</ol></p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04915"><member>The Prime Minister</member>: It has rightly been the practice of successive Prime Ministers not to disclose or discuss details of the procedures and processes by which their recommendations to the Crown for inclusion in honours lists are arrived at, and I do not propose to depart from that practice.</p>

<title>Advancement of Women</title>
<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04927">Ms. Harman asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he will establish law reform committees constituted as proposed in paragraph 66 of the United Nations Nairobi forward looking strategies for women.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04928"><member>Mr. Waddington</member>: My right hon. Friend has no plans to do so. Every Government Department already has a duty to keep under review as appropriate the legislation relevant to its areas of responsibility. The Equal Opportunities Commission has a duty to keep under review the working of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Equal Pay Act 1970 and may review other legislation in the fulfilment of its other statutory duties.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04929">Ms. Harman asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will establish a special office within his Department to monitor periodically and accelerate the process of equitable representation of women as called for in paragraph 88 of the United Nations Nairobi forward looking strategies for women.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04930"><member>Mr. Waddington</member>: The Home Office designated two equal opportunity officers in January 1984. They oversee and monitor the equal opportunities policy within the Departments, including the Civil Service programme of action for women.</p>

<title>National Drugs Unit</title>
<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04939">Sir Eldon Griffiths asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) whether the establishments of forces from which officers are to be seconded to the national drugs co-ordinating units are to be increased so as to enable additional officers to be recruited to replace them;</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04940">(2) if the police officers being seconded to the national drugs unit under the command of Mr. Colin Hewitt are to be placed on central service.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04941"><member>Mr. Giles Shaw</member>: For the period of their service in the national drugs intelligence unit (NDIU), provincial officers are seconded to the Metropolitan police. They do not remain on the strength of their home force and chief officers providing officers to NDIU may replace them for the duration of that secondment; there is thus no need for any increase in establishment. NDIU is funded as a common police service.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04942">This reply also provides information pursuant to my reply of 13 December to a question from my hon. Friend about police officers being seconded to the NDIU.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04943">Mr. Mason asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department what progress has been made in establishing a new national drugs intelligence unit and the creation of drug wings within regional crime squads; and if he will make a statement.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04944"><member>Mr. Giles Shaw</member>: The national drugs intelligence unit, superceding the central drugs intelligence unit, came formally into existence on 1 November. It currently consists of 25 officers drawn from provincial forces as well as from the Metropolitan police together with five officers from Her Majesty's Customs and Excise and 16 civilian staff.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04945">My right hon. Friend has indicated to police authorities his readiness to approve appropriate increases in establishments of regional crime squads, to make provision for drugs wings, which they are currently considering.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04946">Mr. Mason asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the estimated extra annual expenditure to the South Yorkshire police committee and the metropolitan council in the funding of the new drug wings within regional crime squads; to what extent this will be nationally funded; and if he will make a statement.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04947"><member>Mr. Giles Shaw</member>: The precise arrangements for the funding of each regional crime squad, including drugs wings, are a matter for its constituent police authorities. Eligible expenditure will rank for 50 per cent. police grant from the Home Office in the usual way.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04948">Mr. Mason asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he will meet a delegation from the Association of Metropolitan Authorities to discuss the operational and financial implications of establishing drug
<image src="S6CV0089P0I0722"/>
<col>7</col>
wings within each regional crime squad and the possibilities of national funding; and if he will make a statement.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04949"><member>Mr. Giles Shaw</member>: As the then Home Secretary indicated, we are ready to approve requests for increases in regional crime squad establishments necessary to create drugs wings. The extra expenditure involved will qualify for 50 per cent. police grant from the Home Office in the usual way. Moreover, specific provision has been made in police grant related expenditure to cover local authority expenditure for this purpose.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04950">The addition of drugs wings will not change the operational or other arrangements as regards the control of regional crime squads.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04951">Officials are already in touch with the AMA, and my right hon. Friend is ready to consider any particular issues which it may wish to raise: but we hope that police authorities will play their part in the tripartite system by recognising in financial provision the priority which the Government attaches to the investigation of drugs offences.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-04955"><member>Mr. Giles Shaw</member>: The Commissioner of Police does not disclose details of reward payments. The policy is that payments are made in suitable cases, where there is no risk of compromising the criminal process. They vary in size but the decision is always taken at the highest level within the specialist Operations Department.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-04957">(2) if he will place in the Library a copy of the interim report of the pilot study concerning the co-ordination of planning in home defence region 10; and when the final report is expected.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04958"><member>Mr. Giles Shaw</member>: This study is expected to be complete in a year or so's time after which the results will be made available to the House. An internal report has been made
<col>8</col>
on the first part of the study which has confirmed the need for regional co-ordination. It would not be appropriate to place it in the Library. The study takes into account the agreement referred to in as much as plans made under it bear on regional co-ordination.</p>

No significant changes to the draft regulations are expected, but the guidance's advice on access for disabled people will be revised on the lines explained in the reply given on 5 December 1985 to a question from my hon.

<title>Citizenship</title>
<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04965">Mr. Madden asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make it his policy not to place any impediment in the way of people claiming British citizenship by descent being able to exercise their rights, including rights of appeal, in the same way as Momotaj Begum, the daughter of Nurul-Islam, a British citizen settled here with his wife and other children, following the recent decision of the immigration appeal tribunal in this case.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04966"><member>Mr. Waddington</member>: British citizens do not require leave to enter the United Kingdom under the Immigration Act 1971. The immigration officer's examination of such persons is confined to establishing that they are British citizens. The tribunal determination to which the hon. Member refers concerns rights of appeal, not substantive questions of admission. Passengers who are refused entry because they do not satisfy the. immigration officer that they qualify under the Immigration Act and the rules but who nevertheless can put forward a claim to British citizenship by descent may, as the tribunal confirmed, appeal against refusal on the grounds that they do not need leave to enter.</p>
<image src="S6CV0089P0I0723"/>
<col>9</col>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04967">In the Government's view passengers claiming to be British citizens by descent have such a right of appeal only if there appears to be some basis for the claim. The instructions available to immigration officers cover the matters set out above.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04968">The Government have no immediate proposals for changes in the operation of the immigration control. They do, however, keep these arrangements under continuous re-examination and would not hesitate to take appropriate action if attempts were made to misuse the tribunal's determination to evade the prescribed entry clearance procedures overseas.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-04971">Mr. Corbett asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if he will estimate total spending by local authorities on training, designation and preparation of appropriate staff at each level to cope with peacetime emergencies;</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04972">(2) what, in each of the past five years, has been the level of <i>(a)</i> central Government and <i>(b)</i> local authority spending on planning for non-nuclear emergencies.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-04977">(2) what is his policy towards the collecting of statistics at ports of arrival of the number of immigration cases attracting representations by right hon. and hon. Members; what analyses are carried out of these statistics <i>(a)</i> at the ports of arrival and <i>(b)</i> elsewhere; and if he will make a statement.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04978"><member>Mr. Waddington</member>: At all ports, the number of cases in which a right hon. or hon. Member makes representations is recorded. At terminal 3 Heathrow in the first nine months of this year it is recorded that representations by right hon. or hon. Members were made in about 2,500 cases. These statistics are required as management information both at the ports, and centrally, as a record of the cases themselves, and as a measurement of the work

involved and of the resource implications of that work. The available information is looked at in a variety of ways depending on the issue being examined.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04979">Mr. Dalyell asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) pursuant to the answer of 2 December, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>26,</i> if he will place in the Library any statistical data submitted by the Immigration Service Union in support of its concern expressed at the increase in the number of immigration cases attracting representations from right hon. and hon. Members; and if he will make a statement;</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-04981">(3) what information he has disclosed to representatives of immigration service officers about the number of immigration cases attracting representations by right hon. and hon. Members; and if he will make a statement.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04982"><member>Mr. Waddington</member>: The statistics available to me of the number of representations made by right hon. and hon. Members about immigration cases are compiled and presented by immigration service management and/or by my private office. I have not received such statistics from representatives of the Immigration Service Union but, in my discussion with it, both I, and it, referred to the considerable increase this year in cases attracting such representations at the ports.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-04991">Mr. Chris Smith asked the Secretary of State for the Environment why, under article 20 of the European Community directive (80/778/EC) relating to the quality of water intended for human consumption, he has applied for a delay on lead for four years and on all private water supplies for 10 years for the United Kingdom as a whole, rather than specified geographical areas thereof.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04992"><member>Mr. John Patten</member>: The Government's response of 1983 to the ninth report of the Royal Commission on environmental pollution set a target date of December 1989 for reducing lead concentrations in drinking water to acceptable levels. Our application to the European Commission under article 20, which is consistent with that policy, relates to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and to the areas covered by the Anglian, Severn-Trent, North West and Yorkshire water authorities where major improvement programmes are still under way. These programmes will be substantially complete by the target date.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-04993">Private supplies, although only serving 1 per cent. of the population, are spread throughout the country and in general do not constitute a serious health risk. District councils have a duty to ascertain the wholesomeness of private water supplies and powers to ensure that action is taken to secure improvement when necessary. The article 20 application does not relate to private supplies serving more than 500 people.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-04995"><member>Sir George Young</member>: There is no single authoritative measure of the difficulties faced by a particular area. The Z scores prepared by my Department provide a comparative index of local authority areas, combining six indicators of deprivation based on information at census enumeration district level. They provide a useful guide to the incidence of multiple deprivation, but cannot give a comprehensive picture of an area's social and economic circumstances.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05005"><member>Mr. John Patten</member>: My right hon. Friend has today laid before Parliament the Building (Inner London) Regulations 1985. It is intended that the regulations will come into operation on 6 January 1986. The effect of the regulations is that the building control system will become essentially the same in inner London as in the rest of England and Wales. With certain limited exceptions the Building Regulations 1985 will apply to building work in inner London in place of the present constructional byelaws made under the London Building Acts. The Building (Approved Inspectors, etc) Regulations 1985 will also apply to inner London from 6 January 1986.</p>
<col>14</col>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05006">The Greater London council and the district surveyor service will be responsible for administering the new system for inner London until 1 April 1986, when responsibility for this function will pass to the inner London borough councils and the Corporation of the City of London.</p>

Reporting standards have improved but they vary between water authorities and this makes comparisons unreliable. Ignoring those variations, the north west has about 14 per cent. of the collapses in England and Wales. The rate of collapses per kilometre is about the same as for England and Wales as a whole.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05021">Mr. Nicholas Winterton asked the Secretary of State for the Environment what was the crude surplus by which the number of dwellings in England and Wales exceeded the number of households in the latest year for which figures are available; and how this figure compares with the adjusted figure, taking into account second homes, unfit dwellings, unoccupied dwellings undergoing repair and concealed households.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05022"><member>Sir George Young</member>: 1981 is the most recent year for which information is available about each of the items referred to in the question. The "crude surplus" of dwellings over households in England and Wales was:
<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="right"><i>Number</i></td>

<td align="right">19,086,000</td>

<td>Households</td>
<td align="right">18,293,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Crude surplus"</td>
<td align="right">793,000</td>
</tr>
</table></p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05023">There is no unique conventional set of adjustments to be made to the crude surplus. The 1981 figures for the item referred to in the question are:
<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="right"><i>Number</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Second residences, including holiday accommodation</td>
<td align="right">221,000</td>

<td align="right">1,207,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Concealed families</td>
<td align="right">343,000</td>
</tr>
</table></p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05024">Some of the concealed families are likely to have lived that way from choice. There is probably some overlap between vacant dwellings undergoing improvement and unfit dwellings. Many of the unfit dwellings could prabably be made fit by remedial work.</p>

<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05136">Mr. Hardy asked the Secretary of State for Energy if he will explain without reference to mathematical formulae the basis upon which gas price increases are to be controlled or influenced following privatisation.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05137"><member>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</member>: The price of gas to tariff customers will be strictly controlled by reference to changes in the retail price index and changes in gas costs. The maximum price (covering both standing charge arid rate per therm) that can be charged will be determined by the price formula set out in the licence.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05138">The price formula itself is in two parts:
<quote>(i) a part relating to the cost of gas purchased (Y in the formula) which provides for changes in gas costs to be directly reflected in the maximum price. At present the cost of gas accounts for about half of the price customers pay.</quote>
<quote>(ii) the remaining part of the price (RPI&#x2014;X in the formula) which is limited to X per cent. below the rate of inflation. This puts a discipline on the company to achieve real reductions in the non-gas costs under its control and will ensure that customers take a share of the benefit. The value of X, the efficiency factor, will be set when the scope for improved efficiency has been assessed.</quote></p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05176"><member>Mr. Luce</member>: I have today authorised a start on the second stage of the building, which is estimated to cost &#x00A3;61 million and will be ready for occupation in 1993.

<title>British Film Institute</title>
<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05179">Mr. Dormand asked the Minister for the Arts whether he will increase the grant to the British Film Institute; and if he will make a statement.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05180"><member>Mr. Luce </member><i>[pursuant to his reply.</i> 9 December 1985, c. <i>620&#x2013;21]</i>: I am now able to announce further details of the arts budget for 1986&#x2013;87, including the allocation for the British Film Institute.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05181">The central Government element of the arts and libraries programme has been set at &#x00A3;321 million for 1986&#x2013;87, an increase of nearly 18 per cent. in cash over the corresponding provision for 1985&#x2013;86. Subject to parliamentary approval of the Supply Estimates, I propose the main 1986&#x2013;87 allocations listed below. The greater part of the increase reflects the additional central funding for the performing arts, film and museums, following the abolition of the Greater London council and the metropolitan county councils. The grants to most bodies directly supported from my central Government programme will be broadly in line with the provisional forward planning figures for 1986&#x2013;87 given to them last January. But it has been possible in some cases to make modest additional provision for new developments or other special needs.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05182">As I announced to the House on 14 November 1985 at columns 700&#x2013;710, the grant to the Arts Council in 1986&#x2013;87 will be &#x00A3;135&#x00B7;6 million, including increased central post-abolition funding of &#x00A3;25 million. The grant to the British Film Institute will be &#x00A3;9&#x00B7;738 million (20 per cent. more than in 1985&#x2013;86): this includes &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 million for post-abolition funding, and a further &#x00A3;0&#x00B7;3 million above its provisional planning figure to help with matching funding for film production and with the Institute's accommodation needs.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05183">For the major museums and galleries affected by the abolition of the GLC and metropolitan county councils, I propose the following arrangements.</p>
<col>36</col>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05184">First, an order in council will be made under section 46 of the Local Government Act 1985 to establish a new trustee body with responsibility for the bulk of the museums and galleries hitherto administered by Merseyside county council. A grant-in-aid of &#x00A3;8&#x00B7;745 million will be made to the trustee body for these institutions in 1986&#x2013;87</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05185">Secondly, a grant-in-aid of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;075 million will be made in 1986&#x2013;87 to the existing trustee body responsible for the Greater Manchester Museum of Science and Industry, which has hitherto been funded by Greater Manchester county council.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05186">Thirdly, subject to the enactment of the Museum of London Bill currently before the House, the Government's grant to that museum will be increased to &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;25 million in 1986&#x2013;87, reflecting the proposal in the Bill that the Government's share of the museum's main budget will be raised from the present one-third to one-half.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05187">Fourthly, I am allocating an additional &#x00A3;1&#x00BC; million to the Museums and Galleries Commission for pump-priming grants to other museums and gallery services affected by abolition.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05188">Finally, some provision for certain affected museums is being channelled separately, as follows: for the Manchester university museum and Whitworth gallery, through the University Grants Committee; for the London historic house museums, through the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission; and the Geoffrye and Horniman museums will be maintained by the Inner London Education Authority, whose expenditure limit and grant-related expenditure assessment for 1986&#x2013;87 take account of this transfer.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05189">I will be making a separate announcement in due course following the recent consultations on arrangements for the treatment of revenue generated by the nine national museums and galleries for which I am responsible. That announcement will also cover the provision to be made in 1986&#x2013;87 for those institutions' purchase grants, other net running costs, and the building and maintenance programme undertaken for them by the Property Services Agency.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05190">Meanwhile, as regards the other institutions in the museum field for which I am responsible, the grant to Sir John Soane's museum in 1986&#x2013;87 will be &#x00A3;250,000, including a supplementary allocation towards the improvement of its building and facilities; and, for the Museums and Galleries Commission. I am making additional provision for increased staffing and accommodation requirements and for the establishment of a new Conservation Unit to provide advice on conservation facilities and on training opportunities available throughout the country. The <i>&#x00A3;1&#x00BD;</i> million conservation grant fund administered by the commission, introduced two years ago, will be continued in 1986&#x2013;87, as will the existing schemes of grants for Area Museum Councils and for purchases and capital development by local museums.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05191">As in 1985&#x2013;86, the grants to the Crafts Council and the National Film and Television school will in 1986&#x2013;87 include modest additional provision for special regional or capital developments during the year. A token sum is allocated to the South Bank Theatre Board, which is to be wound up as soon as its responsibilities for settling the outstanding accounts for the initial construction and equiping of the National theatre building have been discharged. The voted provision for the National Heritage memorial fund and for acceptances of art objects in lieu
<image src="S6CV0089P0I0737"/>
<col>37</col>
of tax (both of which also receive corresponding sums from Department of the Environment votes) will remain at the same level as in 1985&#x2013;86. The new arrangements for supplementing the acceptance in lieu provision, announced on 26 July last <i>[Official Report,</i> Vol, 83, Col. 777], will of course continue to apply.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05192">In view of the sustained success of the business sponsorship incentive scheme launched in 1984, I have decided to make a further increase in its allocation, to &#x00A3;1&#x00BE; million next year. This should yield some &#x00A3;6 million or more from combined public and private sources for sponsored activities in arts bodies. I shall keep under careful review the arrangements for 1:1 matching grants for first-time sponsorship and 1:3 matching grants for additional sponsorship.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05193">The recurrent grant to the British Library will be increased to &#x00A3;49&#x00B7;8 million in 1986&#x2013;87, including an allowance towards initial expenditure on its corn stores storage project for its lending division in Boston Spa. Provision will be made on the Property Services Agency vote for continued expenditure on construction of the present stage of the Library's new St. Pancras building, and for net expenditure on the Library's existing accommodation. I am making a separate announcement about the next stage of the St. Pancras project.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05194">The grant to the Royal Commission on historical manuscripts will be raised to &#x00A3;0&#x00B7;54 million next year, including a special allowance for computerisation of its records. The ceiling for the public lending right scheme, which was substantially increased to &#x00A3;2&#x00BE; million in 1985&#x2013;86, will remain at that level in 1986&#x2013;87.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05195">These allocations are within the arts and libraries programme total given in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Autumn Statement. Plans for 1987&#x2013;88 and 1988&#x2013;89 will be summarised in the next Public Expenditure White Paper, and will be subject to annual review. Provisional planning figures for those years will be communicated to the arts bodies concerned early in the Next Year.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05196">Details of the main allocations covered by today's announcement for 1986&#x2013;87, compared with the provision originally made for 1985&#x2013;86 (as amended by Supplementary Estimates where relevant), are set out in the following table.

<title>Schools (Lunchtime Supervision)</title>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05202">Mr. Freud asked the Secretary of State for Education and Science what is the ratio of supervisors to pupils and the amount to be paid per hour of supervision upon which his Department's calculation of &#x00A3;40 million as the cost of lunchtime supervision in a full year is based; and if he will make a statement.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05203"><member>Mr. Chris Patten</member>: The figure of &#x00A3;40 million was arrived at after considering a range of costs and staffing levels because different staffing ratios and rates of pay may be appropriate within the new arrangements to be supported by education support grant according to local circumstances. Such local differences might arise, for example, from variations in the numbers of supervisory assistants already employed and in the qualities of the staff which need to be recruited. Thus the sum of &#x00A3;40 million is not based on any single staffing ratio or rate of pay, but the Government are satisfied that it will suffice to provide reliable and adequate supervision in schools in England and Wales.</p>

<li>(1) For 1986&#x2013;87 the rate of contribution is assessed at &#x00A3;1 in &#x00A3;7 for residual incomes from &#x00A3;8,700 to &#x00A3;11,100; then <i>&#x00A3;1</i> in &#x00A3;5 to <i>&#x00A3;16,200;</i> then &#x00A3;l in &#x00A3;4 thereafter. In 1985&#x2013;86 the rate of contribution was assessed at &#x00A3;1 in &#x00A3;7 from &#x00A3;8,100 to &#x00A3;10,300; then &#x00A3;1 in &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;15,000; then in &#x00A3;4 thereafter.</li>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05216"><member>Mr. Raison</member>: Using the information in the report of the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission on 8 October 1985, which gives a food requirement of 500 grammes of grain per person per day, I estimate that it costs 12&#x00B7;6 pence to feed one person for one day in Ethiopia with imported food aid, including purchase, shipping and internal transport.</p>

It is clear that the suffering has been great, but the scale of the tragedy that loomed a year ago has been much reduced thanks to the resilience of the Ethiopian people and the response of the international community.</p>

<title>Youth Training Programme</title>
<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05222">Mr. Hume asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what is the total funding for the youth training programme in Northern Ireland; how it is allocated to the various providers; what percentage of the total funding comes from the European Economic Community; what is the cost per training place for each provider; what is the cost of the Civil Service administration of the youth training programme; and what number of civil servants are involved in the administration.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05223"><member>Dr. Boyson</member>: For the total funding of the youth training programme and its allocation to the various providers, I would refer the hon. Gentleman to the reply I gave him on 11 November 1985 at columns <i>97&#x2013;8.</i></p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05224">Eligible expenditure on the provision of the YTP attracts 55 per cent. assistance from the European social fund.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05225">As more than one provider is involved in delivering each young person's programme of training, further education and work experience, the cost of a training place can not be allocated per provider. In 1984&#x2013;85, 5,289 first year full-time training places were delivered for a total cost of &#x00A3;20&#x00B7;8 million; the figures for second year full-time training places were 2,000 and &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;9 million. The cost per training place was therefore &#x00A3;3,076 for the first year and &#x00A3;3,950 for second year trainees. These figures do not take account of a further 1,473 first-year full-time training places which were sponsored by the Government training centres, the costs of which were included in the GTC running costs. Ninety eight civil servants are employed full-time in the administration of YTP at an annual cost of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 million. There is also additional indirect and part-time input by other civil servants which can not be readily quantified.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05237"><member>Mrs. Chalker</member>: There are no signs giving the wavelengths of Pennine Radio or Radio Leeds on the M1 , M62 and A1. The only radio station signs on these roads in South or West Yorkshire refer to Radio Hallam and Radio Sheffield. These signs were erected as part of an experiment to assess whether such signs should be introduced nationally.

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05247"><member>Mrs. Chalker</member>: The costs for the M25-M1 interchange cannot readily be separated from the total costs for contract 2 of the Micklefield Green to South Mimms section of M25, which also includes lengths of the main M25 carriageway on both sides of the interchange and a junction with A405 to the east. The estimated main works cost for contract 2 was given as &#x00A3;24&#x00B7;7 million at November 1982 prices in "Policy for Roads in England: 1983". The final main works cost will depend on the rate of inflation throughout the contract and the determination of any contractual claims.

<image src="S6CV0089P0I0742"/>
<col>47</col>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05269"><member>Mr. Ridley</member>: Section 13 of the London Regional Transport Act 1984 empowers me to make a levy on London ratepayers to recover up to two-thirds of the cost of my total grants to London Regional Transport. I have today laid before Parliament a draft levy order, which is subject to affirmative resolution. This provides for a levy in 1986&#x2013;87 of 9&#x00B7;79 pence in the pound which is estimated to raise &#x00A3;193&#x00B7;6 million. This is equivalent to 65&#x00B7;6 per cent. of my estimated expenditure on grants to LRT in 1986&#x2013;87 of &#x00A3;295 million, the balance of &#x00A3;101&#x00B7;4 million being found from the Exchequer.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05270">By comparison with 1985&#x2013;86 these proposals represent a reduction in grant of &#x00A3;28 million and a reduction in the call on ratepayers of &#x00A3;18&#x00B7;4 million. The burden on the ratepayers falls by slightly more than a penny in the pound, while the proportion of expenditure they fund has been held constant.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05271">My proposals reflect London Regional Transport's major achievements to cut costs while providing more efficient and responsive pubic transport services in the capital. My proposals sustain an increased programme of investment, directed mainly at cost-saving projects and modernisation of the system, and provide &#x00A3;5 million for the funding by LRT of Dial-a-Ride services for the disabled.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05272">Further details of LRT's proposals for 1986&#x2013;87 are given in its annual business plan which I understand is being published today. Copies will be made available to hon. Members.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05284"><member>Mr. Brooke</member>: The Budget Council met in Strasbourg on Wednesday/Thursday of last week. I represented the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05285">The Council and the representatives of the European Parliament failed to reach agreement on the Community budget for 1986. The Council decided nevertheless by qualified majority to propose a further 242 mecu (some &#x00A3;150 million at the budget exchange rate of 1&#x00B7;61 ecu to the pound) of payment appropriations for non-obligatory

<col>49</col>
expenditure, on top of the provision proposed in the Council's revised draft budget, provided that agreement could be reached in the Parliament's plenary on this figure. I voted against this decision on the grounds that the figures in the Council's revised draft budget were already too high and represented a threat to budget discipline.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05286">The Parliament's plenary voted on Thursday to increase the Council's revised draft budget figures by the larger sum of some 570 mecu in payment appropriations (about &#x00A3;355 million). This figure rises to some 630 mecu (about &#x00A3;390 million) after including the consequential increase in transitional refunds for Spain and Portugal. The Parliament also voted to increase the provision for commitment appropriations by some 410 mecu (about &#x00A3;255 million).</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05289"><member>Mr. MacGregor</member>: Those contributions in lieu of rates made centrally by Her Majesty's Treasury are on property deemed to be occupied by the Crown for public purposes. Estate holding departments are responsible for any arrangements reached with private sector organisations acting on their behalf and where the private sector occupation is for that public purpose the rating position remains unchanged.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05306">(2) what changes would be necessary to higher rate bands to ensure that no tax benefit accrues to higher rate taxpayers if a lower rate band is introduced at 15 per cent. to apply to half the present 30 per cent. tax-rate band.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05307"><member>Mr. Moore </member><i>[pursuant to his replies,</i> 6 December 1985, c. <i>356]</i>: The direct revenue cost of introducing an income tax rate of 15 per cent. to apply to the first &#x00A3;8,100 of taxable income would be about &#x00A3;14&#x00B7;4 billion in a full year at 1985&#x2013;86 income levels.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05308">It is not possible to alter the higher rate structure to withdraw completely the benefit of the lower rate band from all existing higher rate taxpayers without also reducing the benefit which the band would give to those currently liable at the basic rate. By way of illustration, leaving the present higher rate structure as it stands but charging tax at 45 per cent. on taxable income between &#x00A3;8,100 and &#x00A3;16,200 would withdraw the whole of the
<image src="S6CV0089P0I0744"/>
<col>51</col>
benefit of the lower rate band from higher rate taxpayers. This structure would, however, mean that taxable income between &#x00A3;16,200 and &#x00A3;19,200 would be charged at a lower rate (40 per cent.) than the taxable income between &#x00A3;8,100 and &#x00A3;16,200. The net cost of this rate structure (including the lower rate band of &#x00A3;8,100 at 15 per cent.) would be about &#x00A3;11. billion.</p>

<title>"Burdens on Business"</title>
<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05357"><member>Mr. Sheerman</member> asked the Paymaster General what is his estimate of the time per employer spent on paperwork for compliance with the regulations covered in the "Burdens on Business" White Paper; and if he will estimate the past, present and future monetary costs to the small firm for this compliance.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05358"><member>Mr. Trippier</member>: The information is not available in the form requested. The findings of the "Burdens on Business" scrutiny included evaluations by businesses of the time and costs involved in complying with various Government regulations. As proposed in "Lifting the Burden" (Cmnd. 9571), the Government are setting in hand new arrangements to assess the costs to business of compliance with new regulatory proposals.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05359"><member>Mr. Sheerman</member> asked the Paymaster General if he will list the available evidence that he referred to in his written answer on 10 December; and if he will place the material referred to in the Library.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05360"><member>Mr. Trippier</member>: "Lifting the Burden" (Cmnd. 9571) refers to the evidence collected in a survey of 200 businesses by Research Associates as part of the "Burdens on Business" report which was published in March. The survey shows that 52 of the firms questioned reported that they had lost or not taken on an average of 6&#x00B7;5 employees each year over the last five years due to the inhibiting or costly effect of regulations. Copies of both Cmnd. 9571 and "Burdens on Business" were placed in the Library.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05361"><member>Mr. Sheerman</member> asked the Paymaster General what is his estimate of the total number of jobs lost as a result of the burden of regulations on small firms; and if he will list the present number of small firms in the economy and the total number of persons employed by these firms.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05362"><member>Mr. Trippier</member>: The White Paper "Lifting the Burden" (Cmnd. 9571) pointed out that it is not possible to prove
<col>56</col>
a direct causal relationship between deregulation and job creation or conversely between regulations and jobs lost. Hence, no reliable estimate can be provided though the available evidence suggests that there is a link between deregulation and jobs through stimulating economic activity.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05363">There are a number of difficulties (such as the definition of a small business) in the way of giving an accurate count of the number of small businesses, but on the basis of VAT registrations there would seem to be over 1&#x00B7;5 million small businesses in the economy. While accurate information on employment in small firms is not available, these firms probably provide employment for over one quarter of the employed labour force.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05364">The Department is investigating possible methods of improving the quality of information on the level of employment in small firms without increasing the burdens on small businesses.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05365"><member>Mr. Sheerman</member> asked the Paymaster General what is his estimate of the costs for the formation and administration of the deregulation units resulting from the "Burdens on Business" White Paper proposals; and if he will list the costs for each unit.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05366"><member>Mr. Trippier</member>: The enterprise and deregulation unit established to co-ordinate follow-up to "Lifting the Burden" across Government generally has a total staff of 12. In addition, a number of Departments have established their own internal units with, on average, one full-time official engaged on deregulation. The cost of these arrangements is small compared with the prospective benefits of reducing the burden on regulations.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05367"><member>Mr. Sheerman</member> asked the Paymaster General if he will list the agencies created for industrial development and the agencies created for reducing regulations on small firms.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05368"><member>Mr. Trippier</member>: My Department does not have records of all agencies created to encourage industrial development. However, local enterprise agencies fall into this category, and according to my Department's records there are currently 310 agencies in operation. A list of these has been placed in the Library.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05369">One of the major tasks of the regional enterprise units (REUs) that have recently been established by my Department is to help the work of the enterprise and deregulation unit in promoting business enterprise by identifying burdens on small firms. A list of the REUs has also been placed in the Library.</p>

<title>Enterprise Allowance Scheme</title>
<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05370"><member>Mr. Sheerman</member> asked the Paymaster General what is his estimate of the average waiting period between applying for funding from the enterprise allowance scheme and receiving the grant.</p>
<image src="S6CV0089P0I0747"/>
<col>57</col>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05371"><member>Mr. Trippier</member>: It normally takes from two to four weeks from the date an application is made to the date it is approved. The allowance is payable as soon as the business starts, which may be immediately upon approval of the application or up to six weeks later, the choice being left to the individual concerned. The first payment is made two weeks after the business has started.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05372"><member>Mr. Sheerman</member> asked the Paymaster General for how long individuals can receive grants from the enterprise allowance scheme; and if he will give his estimate of the percentage of businesses still operating one year after the grants have stopped.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05373"><member>Mr. Trippier</member>: The enterprise allowance is payable for a maximum period of 52 weeks. No evidence is available on the percentage of businesses still operating one year after the grant has stopped, but surveys of participants on the pilot schemes show that 77 per cent. of those taking advantage of the full year's allowance were still trading six months later and 61 per cent. two years later.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05374"><member>Mr. Sheerman</member> asked the Paymaster General if he will list the number of persons joining the enterprise allowance scheme and the percentages of women and minorities participating in the scheme, broken down by year.</p>

<title>Rate Rebate (Lambeth)</title>
<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05453"><member>Mr. John Fraser</member> asked the Secretary of State for Social Services (1) what was the date of the first payment of rate rebate to Lambeth council in the financial year 1985&#x2013;86; and what interest accrued to public funds as a result of it not being paid at an earlier date;</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05454">(2) what is the current annual cost of housing benefit in Lambeth and the cost of administering the scheme.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05455"><member>Mr. Major</member>: The first payment on account of rate rebate subsidy to Lambeth for the year 1985&#x2013;86 was made on 15 July. On the second point, it is not possible to give a figure since the calculation would depend on hypothetical assumptions about how central Government's financing would have been carried out in other circumstances.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05456">Latest estimates provided by the London borough of Lambeth indicate that the cost of housing benefit in 1985&#x2013;86 is expected to be &#x00A3;49 million and the cost of its administration is expected to be &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;5 million.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05458"><member>Mr. Newton</member>: Subject to there being a need for the item and provision for it not being made in the boarding charge, a boarder can, in appropriate circumstances, qualify for the following additional requirements:
<quote><i>(a)</i> extra heating; <i>(b)</i> old age addition; <i>(c)</i> attendance needs; <i>(d)</i> extra baths needed on medical grounds; <i>(e)</i> blindness; <i>(f)</i> boarding out fees for a child prior to adoption; <i>(g)</i> special diet due to illness; <i>(h)</i> fares to visit certain close relatives or friends in hospital; <i>(i)</i> laundry expenses; <i>(j)</i> special wear and tear on clothing; <i>(k)</i> extra cost of special clothing or footwear; and <i>(l)</i> storage of furniture.</quote></p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05459">The limit for a laundry addition is the amount by which the estimated average cost exceeds &#x00A3;0&#x00B7;55 a week.

<title>AIDS</title>
<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05465"><member>Mr. Kirkwood</member> asked the Secretary of State for Social Services what guidelines he has issued to health authorities on the development of local counselling services for carriers of HTLV III virus.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05466"><member>Mr. Hayhoe</member>: Health authorities were asked on 30 July 1985 to plan for the counselling of people found to be HTLV III antibody positive. The AIDS booklets "General Information for Doctors" and "Information for doctors concerning the introduction of the HTLV III antibody test", issued by the Chief Medical Officer in May and October this year, refer to counselling for seropositive individuals. Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05467"><member>Mr. Kirkwood</member> asked the Secretary of State for Social Services what proportion of haemophiliac patients have so far been tested for HTLV III antibody.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05468"><member>Mr. Hayhoe</member>: Most of those exposed to the greatest risk of HTLV III infection have been tested.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05469"><member>Mr. Kirkwood</member> asked the Secretary of State for Social Services how many spouses of haemophiliacs have so far <i>(a)</i> been identified as carriers of HTLV III virus, <i>(b)</i> contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome and <i>(c)</i> died.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05470"><member>Mr. Hayhoe</member>: Complete figures for the number of spouses of haemophiliacs who may be infected with HTLV III are not held centrally, as all testing of haemophiliacs and their partners is entirely voluntary. Of the 120 known to have been tested to date, five have been found to be HTLV III antibody positive. From reports received by the communicable disease surveillance centre, it is understood that one of these five has contracted AIDS. None has died.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05471"><member>Mr. Kirkwood</member> asked the Secretary of State for Social Services what will be the length, content and intake of courses for training health professionals in the counselling of acquired immune deficiency syndrome sufferers.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05472"><member>Mr. Hayhoe</member>: St. Mary's hospital Paddington is running a series of two-day courses for health professionals involved in the counselling of people taking the HTLVIII antibody test and those exposed to the AIDS virus. The courses provide up to date information on the AIDS infection and the specialist skills required for related counselling. To date 380 health professionals have been trained and courses for a further 150 people are planned.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05473">As my right hon. Friend announced on 2 December at columns <i>1&#x2013;2</i> in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Chiselhurst (Mr. Sims) a further &#x00A3;100,000 is being provided next year for AIDS counselling training.

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05475"><member>Mr. Hayhoe</member>: I refer the hon. Member to my right hon. Friend's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) on 2 December at columns <i>1&#x2013;2.</i> The Central Office of Information, Reflexions Ltd (the research company), TBWA (the advertising agency) and the Health Education Council are involved in the planning of the campaign.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05476"><member>Mr. Kirkwood</member> asked the Secretary of State for Social Services, pursuant to the answer of 2 December, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>126,</i> what are the six research projects on acquired immune deficiency syndrome funded by the Medical Research Council; and to which two his Department is contributing money.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05477"><member>Mr. Hayhoe</member>: I understand that the Medical Research Council, which receives grant-in-aid from the science budget of the Department of Education and Science, is currently funding the following six research projects at a total cost of about &#x00A3;431,000.
<ol>
<li>1. Professor M. W. Adler, Dr. R. S. Tedder, (Middlesex hospital medical school) and Dr. Dorothy Crawford (University college, London): an investigation into the immunology and aetiology of AIDS.</li>
<li>2. Dr. J. Craske (PHLS, Withington hospital, Manchester): an epidemiological study of the relationship of AIDS in patients with disorders of blood coagulation to its possible acquisition through treatment with blood products.</li>
<li>3. Dr. D. J. Jeffries (St. Mary's medical school) and Dr. D. Taylor-Robinson (clinical research centre, Harrow): virological investigations of patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</li>
<li>4. Dr. A. J. Pinching (St. Mary's hospital medical school): a study on the killing of intra cellular pathogens by macrophages derived from homosexual males with AIDS and related disorders.</li>
<li>5. Professor R. A. Weiss (Institute of Cancer Research, London): retroviruses associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</li>
<li>6. Dr. C. A. Ludlam (University of Edinburgh): clinical and immunological study of haemophiliacs treated exclusively with NHS Factor VIII/IX concentrate.</li>
</ol>
My Department is contributing a total of &#x00A3;59,000 to Professor Adler's and Dr. Craske's projects.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05478"><member>Mr. Kirkwood</member> asked the Secretary of State for Social Services, pursuant to his answer of 2 December, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>126,</i> what are the problems concerned with discrimination against carriers of the HTLV III virus which he is considering.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05479"><member>Mr. Hayhoe</member>: Experience in this country, the United States and elsewhere indicates the main problems resulting from discrimination may fall mainly in the areas of insurance, employment and education and they are under consideration by the Government.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05485"><member>Mr. Hayhoe</member>: As AIDS is not highly infectious isolation units are not appropriate for AIDS patients. The wide variety of illnesses associated with the infection requires the use of normal district general hospital inpatient and out-patient facilities.</p>

<title>Smoking</title>
<body>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05496"><member>Mr. Bellingham</member> asked the Secretary of State for Social Services how many persons died from smoking-related diseases in the Norfolk North-West constituency in each of the last five years.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05497"><member>Mr. Whitney</member>: It is not possible to be precise. Most deaths associated with cigarette smoking arise from three diseases: lung cancer, chronic bronchitis and "heart attacks" due to obstruction of the arteries of the heart. However, the proportion of deaths attributable to smoking from each of these diseases varies. Furthermore, smoking is also implicated in certain other conditions where no estimate of the numbers of the deaths caused by smoking is available&#x2014;for example, obstruction of the arteries of the lower limbs.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05498">In 1983 the Royal College of Physicians in its report "Health or Smoking?" estimated that at least 90 per cent. of deaths from lung cancer, chronic bronchitis and obstructive lung disease are attributable to smoking. The total number of deaths from the main conditions involved is given in the table.</p>

A copy of the report is in the Library. Regional health authorities are responsible for allocations to English health districts. The allocation of resources to family practitioner committees for their administrative functions in 1985&#x2013;86 was based on their level of expenditure before becoming administratively independent of district health authorities on 1 April 1985.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05530"><member>Mr. Whitney</member>: The Department commissioned a review of research data on the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the management of multiple sclerosis in 1983. This review, carried out by Dr. J. Martin and Professor W. I. McDonald and published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> on 31 March 1984, concluded that the research evidence then available was insufficient to substantiate claims that the treatment was effective, and recommended that further clinical trials be undertaken.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05531">We are aware of two voluntary organisations that are currently conducting clinical trials on the use of the therapy. The Multiple Sclerosis Society has conducted trials at the Royal Victoria hospital in Newcastle and at Whipps Cross and St. Thomas' hospitals in London. All three are now completed and involved a total of 204 patients; the results of the Newcastle trial were published in the <i>Lancet</i> on 9 February 1985, and publication of the results of the other two trials is awaited. Action for Research into Multiple Sclerosis is conducting clinical trials at the Western infirmary in Glasgow and at the Central Middlesex hospital in London involving a total of 180 patients, and the results are expected in 1986.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05532"><member>Mrs. Dunwoody</member> asked the Secretary of State for Social Services if he will list the centres providing hyperbaric oxygen treatment for multiple sclerosis patients.</p>

These returns reflect the costs and profits incurred by companies in their sales of medicines to the Health Service and are the basis upon which the Department determines whether such costs and profits are reasonable.

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05559">The most recent information relates to the last quarter of 1984. At that time the average time for the hearing of appeals relating to all social security benefits was 11&#x00B7;8 weeks in Scotland and 13&#x00B7;9 weeks in Great Britain. Equivalent figures are not available for the United Kingdom or for localities smaller than a Region.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05560"><member>Mr. Peter Bruinvels</member> asked the Secretary of State for Social Services what are the criteria used by his Department
<col>80</col>
for licensing <i>(a)</i> a nursing home and <i>(b)</i> an old people's home; how often each is inspected; what is the minimum number of beds, nurses and other medical staff necessary, including visiting doctors; and if he will make a statement.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05561"><member>Mr. Whitney</member>: Registration of nursing homes is a function exercised by District Health Authorities on behalf of the Secretary of State, and in accordance with part II of the Registered Homes Act 1984 and the Nursing Homes and Mental Nursing Homes Regulations. The legislation provides for every home to be inspected not less than twice in every period of twelve months; does not prescribe a minimum number of beds; and requires the person registered to provide adequate professional, technical, ancillary and other staff and to make adequate arrangements for patients in the home where necessary to receive medical and dental services, and to provide or make arrangements for other facilities and services.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05562">Residential care homes, which include homes for elderly people, with places for four or more people are registered by local social services authorities under part I of the 1984 Act and in accordance with the Residential Care Homes Regulations 1984. Authorities have to inspect registered homes at least once every 12 months. Those registered to run homes have to employ sufficient suitably qualified and competent staff; make arrangements for residents to receive, where necessary, medical and dental services; and provide, or make arrangements for, other facilities and services appropriate to the needs of residents.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05564"><member>Mr. Hayhoe</member>: Copies of an anonymous letter about staff and management matters at the Family Planning Association have been received. I understand that the association's solicitors have issued a statement contending that the letter contains libellous allegations about senior staff of the association.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05568">(2) if he will list the local authorities that continued to pay rate rebates after 1 April 1985 but before they had set a rate.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05569"><member>Mr. Major</member>: Payments on account of rate rebate subsidy were not made to ten authorities who did not set a rate on time since rate rebates are properly payable under the statutory housing benefits scheme only when a rate has

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05576"><member>Mr. Hayhoe</member>: The available figures are given in the tables. Because of changes in the international classification of diseases (ICD), figures from 1979 to date are not comparable with those of earlier years.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05577">Before 1979 it is not possible to distinguish between spontaneous abortion and other forms of abortion, and the statistics for this period include maternal deaths where the interval between the onset of the maternal condition and death is up to one year.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05578">From 1979, the category "All abortion" is defined as pregnancy with abortive outcome, excluding ectopic pregnancy.

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05619"><member>Mr. Norman Lamont</member>: The first Nimrod MR Mk 2 aircraft has already completed its major servicing at British Aerospace, Woodford, and has been returned to service on schedule. The second is currently undergoing its major servicing which, I understand, is also proceeding to programme. We have no plans at present to allocate any further major servicing work to BAe Woodford beyond that already scheduled.

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05620"><member>Mr. Soames</member> asked the Secretary of State for Defence what is his assessment of the present efficiency of the GEC Avionics radar in the airborne early warning Nimrod.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05621"><member>Mr. Norman Lamont</member>: The radar for the Nimrod AEW Mk3 is still under development. It has not yet reached its full performance potential.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05622"><member>Mr. Soames</member> asked the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on GEC's performance on the Nimrod airborne early warning contract.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05623"><member>Mr. Norman Lamont</member>: As I told my hon. Friend on 26 November, at column <i>736,</i> the Nimrod AEW programme causes the Government considerable anxiety. It remains a procurement exercise of which neither the Ministry nor industry can be particularly proud.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05624"><member>Mr. Soames</member> asked the Secretary of State for Defence how many Nimrod airborne early warning aircraft: he has ordered; and what is the latest estimated cost of each aircraft when completed.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05625"><member>Mr. Norman Lamont</member>: Eleven aircraft. Final costs will depend on the outcome of our evaluation of GEC Avionics' proposals for the further development of the Nimrod AEW mission system avionics to an acceptable standard of operation.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05626"><member>Mr. Soames</member> asked the Secretary of State for Defence (1) if he is considering accepting the Nimrod airborne early warning aircraft at a lower level of performance specification than originally required;</p>

Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) on 29 October, at column <i>474,</i> and to my hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble (Mr. Atkins) on 9 December at column <i>545.</i></p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05629"><member>Mr. Soames</member> asked the Secretary of State for Defence what will be the effect on United Kingdom air defence if the Nimrod airborne early warning system is not in service by 1986.</p>
<p id="S6CV0089P0-05630"><member>Mr. Norman Lamont</member>: The Nimrod AEW system is planned to provide an important component of the United Kingdom's overall air defence capability and the United Kingdom's contribution to the NATO mixed AEW force. The delay in the introduction of the system is therefore a matter of concern. In the meantime, however, the RAF's Shackletons still provide a useful contribution to AEW capability and the air defence of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p id="S6CV0089P0-05660"><member>Mr. Stanley</member>: Training in all branches of the armed forces is kept under review in an effort to identify possible improvements and a number of such improvements in the training of the UDR have either recently been set in hand or are about to be introduced, as follows:
<ol>
<li>(a) The basic training of part-time members of the regiment is to be increased from nine to 14 days. The extra five days will be completed within the recruits' first three months of service.</li>
<li>(b) Until now UDR officers, full or part-time, have attended a two-week course at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, but from next year selected permanent cadre officers will be eligible to attend the six-month standard military course taken by potential officers in the Regular Army.</li></ol></p>
