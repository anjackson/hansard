      <title>Driving Licences</title>
      <p><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. David Jamieson)</member>: Legislation that was laid before Parliament by the previous administration on 11 November 1996 and came into effect in January 1997 unintentionally exempted certain drivers from paying a fee for certain short term medical driving licences (that is licences which are restricted on account of the holder's medical condition). However the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) continued to charge such a fee. Corrective action is now being taken by the DVLA.</p>
